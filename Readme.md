# Package Delivery Application

## Exercise Description
Write a command line program that keeps a record of packages processed. Each package information consists of weight (in kg) and destination postal code. Think about these packages in the same way, when you send one using postal office. Data should be kept in memory (please don’t introduce any database engines). 
The program should:
* read user input from console, user enters line consisting of weight of package and destination postal code
* once per minute - write output to console, each line consists of postal code and total weight of all packages for that postal code
* process user command “quit”, when user enters quit to command line as input, program should exit
* take and process command line argument specified at program run – filename of file containing lines in same format as user can enter in command line. This is considered as initial load of package information
* handle invalid input of user (it is up to you how, describe implemented behaviour in readme file)

Sample input:
``` 
3.4 08801
2 90005
12.56 08801
5.5 08079 
3.2 09300
```
 
Input line format:
```
<weight: positive number, >0, maximal 3 decimal places, . (dot) as decimal separator><space><postal code: fixed 5 digits> 
```
Sample output (order by total weight):
```
08801 15.960
08079 5.500
09300 3.200
90005 2.000 
```
Output line format:
```
<postal code: fixed 5 digits><space><total weight: fixed 3 decimal places, . (dot) as decimal separator>
```
Things you may consider using: 
* Unit testing 
* Documentation 
* Programming patterns 
* Thread safety 

Please put your code in a bitbucket/github repository. We should be able to build and run your program 
easily (you may wish to use Maven, Ant, etc). Include instructions on how to run your program.

### Optional bonus task
   
The program should:    
* take and process another command line argument specified at program run – filename of file containing information about fees related to package weight. Once such file is specified as argument then output written to console will contain also total fee for packages sent to certain postal code, see format of file and out here after

Format of file containing fees (sample):
```
10 5.00
5 2.50
3 2.00
2 1.50
1 1.00
0.5 0.70
0.2 0.50
```

Line format:
```    
<weight: positive number, >0, maximal 3 decimal places, . (dot) as decimal separator><space><fee: positive number, >=0, fixed two decimals, . (dot) as decimal separator>
```

Meaning:
* delivery fee of package weighing more than or exactly 10 (kg) is 5.00 (Eur),
* delivery fee of package weighing more than or exactly 5 (kg) and less than 10 (kg) is 2.50 (Eur), etc.
    
Sample output:
```
08801 15.960 7.00
08079 5.500 2.50
09300 3.200 2.00
90005 2.000 1.50
```

Output line format:
```
<postal code: fixed 5 digits><space><total weight: fixed 3 decimal places, . (dot) as decimal separator><space><total fee: fixed 2 decimal places, . (dot) as decimal separator)
```
## How to build
The application is project management and comprehension tool Maven. In the root directory of the project run command:
```
mvn clean package
```

## How to run
Execute via. command line:
```
usage: package-delivery-application [-h] [-i <arg>] [-p <arg>]
 -h,--help               Shows this help.
 -i,--init <arg>         File with initial list of post packages witch
                         should be delivered to posts.
 -p,--price-list <arg>   File with price list of delivery based on the
                         post package weight.
```
